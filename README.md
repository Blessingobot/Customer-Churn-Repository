# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project
# Overview
This repository contains code and resources for analyzing customer churn in a business context. Customer churn is the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. It is important to Understand and predict churn in businesses to retain customers and sustain growth.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not. This will help the company in implementing targeted retention strategies to reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical customer data including various features such as demographic information, usage patterns, and transaction history. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the customer churned or not.

# Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to gain insights into the characteristics of churned and non-churned customers.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Training machine learning models using techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Deployment: Deploying the best-performing model for real-time predictions or integrating it into the company's systems.
